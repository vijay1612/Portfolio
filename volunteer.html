								<article>
									<p><span class="image right"><img src="images/vol6.png" alt="" /></span>During the devastating Kerala floods of 2018, I volunteered to aid those affected by the catastrophe. Witnessing the widespread destruction and displacement of families, I joined hands with the community in relief efforts that spanned over a month. From packing essential groceries across multiple locations to distributing them to those in need, the people of Kerala united tirelessly to assist everyone impacted by the disaster. I was deeply involved in these relief activities, offering assistance in any way I could. It was an immensely rewarding experience to be able to contribute to the recovery efforts during such trying times. Furthermore, I was humbled to receive recognition for my efforts from the District Collector of Kozhikode, who honored me with a certificate of appreciation for my contributions to the relief efforts.</p>
